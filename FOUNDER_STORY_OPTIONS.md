# Founder Story Options for Adrian Neely

## Current Version (Generic)
```
I built Autoquill after watching too many small businesses lose customers to missed calls. 
Not because they didn't care—they were just busy serving other customers.

The idea was simple: what if every business could afford a receptionist that never sleeps, 
never takes a sick day, and treats every caller like they're the most important person in the world?

Today, Autoquill answers thousands of calls daily for businesses just like yours. 
And we're just getting started.

## Option 1: "The Personal Experience" 
*Best if you witnessed this problem firsthand*

```
I built Autoquill after [watching my dentist friend / running my own business / working with] 
lose $15,000 in revenue in one month—all from missed calls during lunch breaks.

The frustrating part? They weren't lazy. They were just busy serving other customers.

I realized every small business faces this: hire a $40K/year receptionist you can't afford, 
or lose customers to voicemail. So I built a third option.

Today, Autoquill answers thousands of calls daily for businesses just like yours. 
And we're just getting started.

## Option 2: "The Career Change Story"
*Best if you came from tech/software background*

```
I spent [X years] building [previous work/industry], but I kept seeing the same pattern: 
small businesses losing customers to missed calls.

As someone who understands AI, I knew this was solvable. Not with a chatbot or a complicated 
phone tree—with a voice agent that actually sounds human.

Six months later, Autoquill was born. An AI receptionist so natural, your customers won't 
know it's AI (and won't care, because they're finally getting answers).

Today, Autoquill answers thousands of calls daily for businesses just like yours.

## Option 3: "The Mission-Driven Story"
*Best if you're passionate about helping small businesses*

```
I built Autoquill because small businesses deserve enterprise-level tools without 
enterprise-level budgets.

Every day, amazing business owners—dentists, plumbers, lawyers—lose customers not because 
they provide bad service, but because they can't answer the phone while serving other customers.

That's not a staffing problem. That's a technology problem. And technology is how we fix it.

Today, Autoquill answers thousands of calls daily for businesses just like yours, 
helping them compete with the big guys.

## Option 4: "The Numbers Story"
*Best if you have specific data/experience*

```
I built Autoquill after discovering that [30% of calls / average small business] go unanswered 
during business hours. Not after hours—during.

That's $50,000+ in lost revenue every year for the average business. Not because they don't care, 
but because they're busy actually serving customers.

I realized: what if every business could afford a receptionist that costs $6/day instead of 
$150/day, and never takes a sick day?

Today, Autoquill answers thousands of calls daily, capturing revenue that used to go to voicemail.
