# Your Founder Story - Two Versions

## Version 1: Current (Detailed & Credible) ✅ LIVE NOW

```
I built Autoquill after experiencing the same frustration we all have: calling businesses 
and getting sent straight to voicemail. It happened over and over—agencies, service providers, 
even my own doctor's office.

Coming from 10+ years in healthcare economics and analytics, I knew the numbers: 30% of calls 
go unanswered, costing small businesses thousands in lost revenue each month. When AI voice 
technology started booming, I realized I could actually solve this problem.

My mission is simple: no one should ever miss an opportunity because they couldn't answer their phone. 
Whether you're a dentist, plumber, or lawyer—you deserve the same AI tools that enterprise companies use, 
without the enterprise price tag.

Originally from Florida, now helping businesses nationwide capture every call, every time.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Relatable problem (everyone hates voicemail)
- ✅ Credibility (10+ years, healthcare economics)
- ✅ Clear mission
- ✅ Personal touch (Florida)
- ✅ Shows you understand data/analytics

## Version 2: Shorter & Punchier (Alternative)

```
I built Autoquill after calling dozens of businesses and getting voicemail—even during business hours.

With 10+ years in healthcare analytics, I knew the data: businesses lose $50,000+ annually from missed calls. 
When AI voice technology matured, I realized I could fix this problem for good.

My mission: no business owner should lose customers because they can't answer the phone while serving other customers. 
Enterprise-level AI, small business pricing.

Originally from Florida, now helping businesses nationwide turn every call into an opportunity.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ More concise (better for skimmers)
- ✅ Specific dollar amount ($50K)
- ✅ Direct value proposition
- ✅ Same credibility markers

## Version 3: More Personal (Alternative)

```
I built Autoquill because I kept calling agencies for my own business and getting sent to voicemail. 
It wasn't just frustrating—it was costing them real money. I knew I could fix it.

After 10+ years building analytics software in healthcare economics, I saw AI voice technology boom 
and realized: this is how we solve missed calls forever.

Coming from Florida with a background in data, I'm on a mission to make sure no business loses opportunities 
because they couldn't answer their phone. You deserve enterprise AI at small business prices.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Most personal/authentic
- ✅ Emphasizes "own business" angle
- ✅ Shows you're a builder, not just a founder
- ✅ Conversational tone
